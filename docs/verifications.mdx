## Introduction

Verification Templates are a way to specify what data to request from a digital wallet. Whenever your organization wants to access information in an individual's wallet or identify someone based on their credentials, you can request the see a verification of the data on their credentials. This can be done digitally using a verification request. First, you'll need to decide what you need to know about the user. Define what attributes you will need to request. Then, decide how you will trust those attributes. You can specify who you trust by the Credential Definition, Schema ID, or Issuer of that data. These are the public pieces of information on the Sovrin network that provide the trust.

Self-attested data is the most basic form of trusted data. You might decide to trust anything the agent sends back. This is similar to how current forms either in person or on the web exist. Perhaps some third-party verification might go on behind the scenes, but for many situations, it doesn't matter where the data has come from. 

Other situations call for more trust. A police officer would need to know who issued someone's drivers license. Our API provides support for both kinds of requested data.

## Create a Verification Definition

<a href="https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis-docs/Streetcred/agency/v1#/Definitions/CreateVerificationDefinition" target="_blank">POST /definitions/verifications</a>



A verification definition is created and saved on your cloud agent. You can discover your definition based on the ID that is returned or the name.

## Additional Information


### Explanation of Restrictions List

In the verification template, the `restrictions` list defines where this data is allowed to come from. The three most useful options include:

- `schemaId`: anyone who creates a credential with a certain schema ID can issue it to an individual. The schema ID only provides trust that the data is in the correct format.
- `credentialDefinitionId`: Because a credential definition is signed by an issuer, the credential definition defines both the format of the data and also who sent it to the wallet. This is the most commonly used restriction when contructing definitions. The credential definition would be an ID that is written to the sovrin ledger, and will prove that the credential an agent sends to you is both issued by the organization and is in the format that you need.
- `issuerDid`: for situations where you only care about where the credential is from and not what format the data is in, you may also use only the issuer's DID. This is also resolvable on the sovrin network and will prove that the data you have received was sent from a trusted source. It will not provide any information around the format of the data that you're receiving.

When sending a Proof Request, you may choose to request an Attribute Proof (TODO: FIND BETTER NAME) or a Predicate Proof. The attribute proofs will reveal the actual data of each attribute you request. The Predicate proofs will only return a `True` or `False` value on whether the attribute matches your specified query. For example, if someone's `Date of Birth` is before 1998, you may request that the person provide their `Year of Birth` attribute, and only from the `Driver's License` or `Passport` credentials issued by the `US Government`:

```js
{
  ...
  "proof_of_year_of_birth": {
    "p_type": "<=",
    "p_value": "1998",
    "name": "Year of Birth",
    "restrictions": [
      {
        "cred_def_id": "<US_drivers_license_cred_def_id>"
      },
      {
        "cred_def_id": "<drivers_license_cred_def_id>"
      }
    ]
  }
   ...
}
```

This will return either a `true` or `false` value to the attribute that a user supplies. If the value's signature matches the signatures stored in the credential definition, it will return true. This value can be trusted to have come from whichever Credential Definition ID has been specified, which can only be created by a unique issuer on the sovrin network.

### Predicate Proofs 
Predicate proofs have three possible types: `>=`, `<=`, and `==`. The `name` must match the attribute name exactly, both in spelling and in capitalization in order to be recognized.
